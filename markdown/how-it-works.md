# How it Works

## Real Estate Backed NFTs. You Invest, and We Do The Rest {#real-estate-backed-nfts-you-invest-and-we-do-the-rest}

Through real estate investment loans, real estate borrowers take out loans and make monthly interest payments. As they make their payments, you receive monthly interest as an investor & NFT owner in that loan. House of Panda facilitates all transactions as a real estate investment platform. So all you have to do is invest.

## NFT Investing doesn’t have to be scary {#nft-investing-doesnt-have-to-be-scary}

You’ll be able to track and manage all of your project portfolios. Your investment is secured by a property, making it impossible to move or duplicate.

All your investments are subjected to fixed returns that are returned gradually by the end project’s term. Buyback systems also exist for you who want to sell the asset before the project ends.
